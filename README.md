# Clustering-US-Energy-Plants-Based-on-their-Environmental-Impact
The goal of this analysis is to develop a model through k-means clustering that accurately clusters power plants based on their environmental impact.  In terms of cluster sizes, we find that close to 70% of US plants are environmentally friendly, while about 30% are not environmentally friendly and still depend on coal.
